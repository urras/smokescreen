ATTENTION: This is not my project. 

It comes to you thanks to the good folks at http://smokescreen.us

If you have any questions, you should direct them here, http://smokescreen.us/contact/

All I did was "beautify" it (http://jsbeautifier.org/), and put it on GitHub so that can get to it easily.

I probably won't do any development with it, I just wanted to look at it.
